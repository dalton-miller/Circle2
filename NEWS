       ryan attempts to take revenge on thomasV for adding so many features

       Suggest `/say ...' in response to an unrecognized `/' command

       The md5sum part of `circle-file:...' URLs can now be specified
         either in the way that the `md5sum' program represents them
         or in the shorter representation that Circle usually uses.
         So if you know an md5sum from a software announcement, then you
